    <h2> Which Tunnel Shall You Proceed Down?</h2>
        
        <p1>      You're an underground mine worker and you come across a main room with three tunnels. <br>
            You can't go back the way you came because the ceiling collasped. <br>
            Down the left-most tunnel, you hear an undistictive animal noise -- it's loud and vicious.<br>
            Down the middle tunnel, you see a bright light blinding your eyes. <br>
            And down the right-most tunnel, you hear rushing water. <br>
           Keep in mind, the incline of the tunnels are so steep that once you go down, you can't come up. <br>
            <strong>What tunnel will you go down in?</strong>
